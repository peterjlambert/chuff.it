**I like building things** for the web. You'd _probably_ enjoy grabbing a beer or coffee with me. I also like reading, writing, strolling around in cities, playing the guitar, coffee, cooking, and photography.

I've been designing and writing code for around seven years now. So far, I've avoided to put myself under one label – to specialise in one thing only – and instead gone for this Jack of all Trades role in the various teams I've had the pleasure of working with. I like all things graphic and digital design, front and backend development, product and strategy, typography and API design, copywriting and CSS architecture.

**I love traveling.** I lived in Canada for a year before university, where I went completely offline and worked as a barista. In September 2015, I embarked upon this nomad thing of traveling the world while working remote. So far, I've lived and worked in Vienna, London, San Francisco, New York, Montréal, Asunción, Rio de Janeiro, and Copenhagen. Keep an eye out on ["Now"](/now) for updates. [Give me a shout](http://twitter.com/johanbrook) if we're in the same city! As of January 2018, I've settled in Stockholm, Sweden.
