**I like the web**. I’ve been designing and building for it since 1999. I’ve lived through the browser wars and the dot-com crash. I love doing what I do. It’s a great thing, being a veteran in what’s still a nascent industry.

Since 2010 I’ve been working for [Logikcull](https://logikcull.com) as a Senior UI Engineer. It’s a fantastic company made of fantastic people, and it gets me out of the house and over to San Francisco every so often. I like to stay flexible but really I’m an HTML/CSS specialist.

I’m also a cyclist, riding road, gravel and mountain bikes. I’m currently the Club Secretary for [Velo Club York](https://veloclubyork.co.uk). I log my rides on [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/petelambert). Yorkshire provides when it comes to cycling.

I’m a [keen photographer](https://500px.com/peterjlambert), I like a bit of snowboarding, I play a bit of guitar and I’ve played bass and sung in a few bands. I pick up new hobbies and passions pretty easily and pretty frequently. If I’m given the opportunity to try something new I’ll usually take it.

I live in York, in the North of England with my beautiful wife and our awesome teenage son.
